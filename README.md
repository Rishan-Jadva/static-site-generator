# Static Site Generator 

The purpose of this project, is to quckly create reports, walkthroughs, write-ups for each room I complete. However, instead of uploading a raw `.md` files to my GitHub, I created a Markdown-to-HTML converter to make it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to parse through.

## THM and HTB rooms
As I progress through various rooms on platforms like TryHackMe (THM) and Hack The Box (HTB), each write-up will be published on the website linked above. These write-ups cover key steps, tools used, challenges encountered, and lessons learned from each lab.

## Tools & Languages Used
* Python (Markdown to HTML converter)
* Bash (automation scripts)
* HTML (webpage structure)
* CSS (styling and layout)
