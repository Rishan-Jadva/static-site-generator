    <article><div><h1>THM - Lookup</h1><h2>Enumeration</h2><h4>Open Ports</h4><ul><li>Port 22 - SSH</li><li>Port 80 - HTTP</li></ul><h4>Nmap</h4><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129155115.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129155115.png"></img></p><h4>Gobuster</h4><p>After running a gobuster scan, there seems to be no directories directly accessible.</p><h2>Website</h2><p>Had to add lookup.thm to /etc/hosts.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129155428.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129155428.png"></img></p><p>There seems to be a login page and upon attempting to login using some random details, it seems to send that request to a login.php page to log in.</p><p>We will now use ffuf to attempt to bruteforce the login page.  Given that we know the there is a different page when using the user admin we will just try to find the password for the admin user.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129164812.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129164812.png"></img></p><p>Here we found the password123 that produced different results however when we place that in the login form, it shows the original error as if the user was incorrect. Let's try and use the password but for a different user.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129165358.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129165358.png"></img></p><p>Here we have found the user jose with the password password123. Logging into the application we have found a new files.lookup.thm subdomain that we have to put in /etc/hosts.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129165945.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129165945.png"></img></p><p>Looking for information about the software we see:</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129170011.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129170011.png"></img></p><p>Looking up vulnerabilities for this software we find CVE-2019-9194 which is a Command Injection vulnerability. Using the exploit I found we receive a shell:</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129171104.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129171104.png"></img></p><p>However, this shell is not functional so we will need to make a reverse shell, going to reverse shell generator we get a reverse shell on our device.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129171605.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129171605.png"></img></p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129171614.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129171614.png"></img></p><p>We will then upgrade the shell:</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129171845.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129171845.png"></img></p><h2>Privilege Escalation</h2><p>We will upload LinPEAS to find vulnerabilities to escalate privilege.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129172848.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129172848.png"></img></p><p>We see a setuid, we have made a vulnerability to make the path that the pwm uses to use id to give use the .passwords of the think user.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129174621.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129174621.png"></img></p><p>Then using hydra we were able to find the correct password given this list:</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129174658.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129174658.png"></img></p><p>We then login as the think use using the correct password. Then we search for commands we can run as sudo on think.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129174813.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129174813.png"></img></p><p>Heading to GTFObins we find that look binary has an exploit. We will use that to escalate the privilege to root. According to GTFObins we are able to read any file we want as root. So what if we read the ssh id<i>rsa for root.</i></p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129175956.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129175956.png"></img></p><p>Login to ssh as root:</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20241129180041.png" alt="Pasted image 20241129180041.png"></img></p></div></article>
