Assuming that pass means passwords we should be able to obtain a username and password for this site. Here we have a portions of what seems to be an MD5 hash:</p><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/Pasted image 20241202045610.png" alt="Pasted image 20241202045610.png"></img></p><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/Pasted image 20241202045737.png" alt="Pasted image 20241202045737.png"></img></p><p>We cannot seem to crack this hash so we will now try and locate the processlist because we see that the admin account is logging in regularly so we are able to run a large payload to see the admin user and password:</p><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/Pasted image 20241202052721.png" alt="Pasted image 20241202052721.png"></img></p><p>Now we are able to login to ssh as admin:</p><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/Pasted image 20241202052820.png" alt="Pasted image 20241202052820.png"></img></p></div></article>
